<p>Jocuri Unity 3D is an online gaming site specializing in Unity 3D games.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pet project of mine to learn SEO and test experiments.</p>

<p>The main screen of the website features a Netflix inspired layout of games.</p>

<p>I implemented a block to force users to play without adblock. Adblock agents block the users browser from making any requests to known ad domains and any websites or files with the word &ldquo;ads&rdquo; in it. I created a file called showads.js and added a single global variable called AdblockIsDisabled = true; Then after 30 seconds I check for the presence of this variable. If it&rsquo;s false or undefined, I know the users browser has an adblocker and I replace the game with this message.</p>

<p>Forms have clear error messages displayed to the user.</p>

<p>I went with responsive design to handle mobile pages as it allows for quicker updates to the site as a whole.</p>
