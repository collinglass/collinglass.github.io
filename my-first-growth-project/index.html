<p>At the time, Pokemon Go had not been released in Canada at the time. Many small businesses were already capitalizing on the local opportunity in the U.S.</p>

<p>My biz partner Mark and I decided to see if local businesses in our community were interested in a managed Pokemon Go service.</p>

<p>We also wanted to test to see if marketers and growth hackers are looking for an authoritative source in marketing to Pokemon Go players.</p>

<p>We have two ideas to test:</p>

<ol>
<li>Marketers are looking for an authoritative source to market to Pokemon Go players</li>
<li>Local businesses will pay for a managed service</li>
</ol>

<p>We decided we would start testing idea 1 with a landing page. Idea 2 was better suited for cold call emailing.</p>

<p>We also decided that this venture needed to make at least 1,000$/month for it to make sense for us.</p>

<h1 id="test-1">Test #1</h1>

<p>We were excited to put together a landing page and launch it to Growth Hackers. We figured this is buzzing right now, we&rsquo;ll be able to score a few 100 signups.</p>

<p>We did some research. Shops were seeing increases in sales by adding lure modules to the nearest pokestop around their business. We decided to put together a PDF guide on how to add a lure module to your business.</p>

<p>We created a landing page that required an email opt-in to get the guide.</p>

<p><img src="https://collinglass.github.io/img/first-landing-pokebiz.png" width="750" alt="First Landing Page"/></p>

<p>We waited until the next morning to post it. We then posted it to GrowthHackers got a few friends to upvote to give it some initial traction.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looked like:</p>

<p><img src="https://collinglass.github.io/img/gh-pokebiz.png" width="750" alt="Pokebiz's first article on GH"/></p>

<p>We waited 14 days before concluding the results.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>We got 6 upvotes from our friends which got us in the trending.</p>

<p>The results were disappointing:</p>

<p>We got 0 organic upvotes.</p>

<p>257 views and 4 email opt-ins.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about a 1.56% conversion rate.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>This was a fail.</p>

<p>We believe this experiment failed for many reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>There are other more authoritive sites covering pokemon go marketing already.</li>
<li>There are other sites where you can get this guide without entering your email.</li>
<li>People are unsure or don&rsquo;t believe Pokemon Go is worth investing time into.</li>
</ol>

<p>In hindsight, it may seem obvious this wasn&rsquo;t going to work. In the moment it felt better to test.</p>

<h1 id="test-2">Test #2</h1>

<p>Once the landing page was out we started working on our email campaign.</p>

<p>We decided to go after pizza shops and coffee shops. They were the businesses getting the most attention in the press.</p>

<p>I wrote a script that scraped facebook for leads. I got 113 Ottawa coffee shops with emails and about the same for pizza shops.</p>

<p>Mark wrote the email and we included a link to our website. We finished scraping and writing up the email on Saturday. We scheduled the email blast for first thing Monday morning.</p>

<p>Our emails went out a day after Pokemon Go was released in Canada, our timing was perfect.</p>

<h2 id="results-1">Results</h2>

<p>We got 11 replies wanting to schedule a meeting. We were pumped.</p>

<p>We felt like we had validation. Everytime I got a new email back we had a big grin on our face.</p>

<p>We scheduled meetings starting Wednesday morning, only two days away. We were moving fast.</p>

<p>I knew I didn&rsquo;t want to go into these meetings pitching. I wanted to do customer development. But, I also needed to have answers to their questions. We took to the whiteboard again and put together an offering.</p>

<p>For 60$/month:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advertisement on our Pokemon Groups</li>
<li>Guides/Installation Support</li>
<li>Insights</li>
<li>One 4 hour event</li>
</ul>

<p>We came out with this number with a mix of cost calculations and revenue projections. It would take us 20 customers to make 1200$/month. Not a lot of money but it was a number that motivated us for a side project.</p>

<p>Note, we never pitched this offering in the meeting. Instead, it provided Mark and I a base point we were comfortable with. This allowed us to ask the right questions and feel out if this was going to be a viable business.</p>

<p>Over the course of the next week we had 1 in-person meeting and the rest were over the phone.</p>

<p>What we found out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All the shops were either going to or already putting lures themselves</p></li>

<li><p>They were all interested in getting insights</p></li>

<li><p>They were interested in helping us out</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With every meeting, something became clearer. It was going to be hard to make money with this business.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>

<p>The local businesses that would profit from a Pokemon Go presence had young staff. They were already running or preparing to run lure modules.</p>

<p>Our leads were interested in getting insights. But, they weren&rsquo;t ready to pay for insights. If they did, it going to be a large amount of money.</p>

<p>They were interested in advertising opportunity if we had clear numbers to show them.</p>

<p>We ran some numbers from the shops point of view.</p>

<p>If we brought them 40 customer purchases a month at 3$ average sale amount, that gives them:</p>

<p>40 * 3$ = 120$</p>

<p>I looked around online to find coffee shop profit margins. This <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-profit-does-Starbucks-make-on-a-typical-coffee">quora question</a> had the best result with 33% profit margin. Calculating their profit:</p>

<p>120$ * 33% = 40$</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we would charge them 25% of that. 10$ a month for our service.</p>

<p>For this venture to make enough revenue for us we need to scale to at least 100 customers. Which means we&rsquo;d had to be responsible for 4,000 customer purchases a month.</p>

<p>Our Facebook Group only had +400 members and the top Facebook group in Ottawa only had 2,000 members.</p>

<p>We looked at increasing monthly fee to 20$, requiring us to scale to at least 50 customers. We would have to be responsible for 2,000 customer purchases a month. Even with the combined reach of the existing Facebook, Slack and Discord communities, this wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>We deemed this business not viable.</p>

<p>The profits were too low for our interest. Additionally, this business is at the mercy of the popularity of Pokemon Go. Mark and I are not confident enough that it&rsquo;s here to stay. Especially here in Ottawa where it&rsquo;ll be -20 outside in a short few months.</p>
