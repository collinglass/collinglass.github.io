<p>It&rsquo;s been a few months now that I have been interested in Growth. I started my growthhackers.com account around Christmas 2015.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been drawn to growth roles because it&rsquo;s the type of role that my ideal self has held for a long time now. Since, I was in high school dreaming about my university choices and subsequent career path. I saw myself as a half business / half programming dude.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built the systems for multiple startups, each one has gotten farther along then the last. But, each time there has been a problem with traction and revenue.</p>

<p>I got some newly found enthusiasm after readon some of nat eliason&rsquo;s stuff. Particularly his lifestyle business post.</p>

<p>He showed the step by step process of building a modest passive income which has been more refreshing than reading about how unicorns like pinterest and uber are excelling growth.</p>

<p>With the release of pokemon go and the small businesses capitalizing on it. My partner Mark and I decided to see if local businesses in our community would be interested in a managed service where we grow their presence on Pokemon Go.</p>

<p>Growth Hackers Projects is out of my budget so I customized a trello board to use the same design. I&rsquo;m going to hack on an open source trello clone (Wekan) to be a lot closer to the Projects workflow, but this is good enough for now.</p>

<p>We have two ideas being tested.</p>

<ol>
<li>GrowthHackers.com contains some of our target market</li>
<li>People would sign up their email in exchange for a FREE pdf Guide with a quick above the fold CTA.</li>
</ol>

<p>We created a landing page to test our hypothesis.</p>

<p>And we&rsquo;re going to analyze our results in 14 days.</p>

<p>&hellip;writing this article I just got an &ldquo;oh no!&rdquo; moment.</p>

<h3 id="wait-this-isn-t-going-to-get-us-conclusive-results">Wait, this isn&rsquo;t going to get us conclusive results</h3>

<p>Why? Because Growth Hackers might be our target but, they don&rsquo;t convert on our landing page. Or they are not our target market and our landing page converts. It&rsquo;s probably both but, we are stuck with the same problem.</p>

<p>New test to counter Test #2: people will sign up if they had long form content and then opted-in for a content upgrade.</p>

<p>Next post, I&rsquo;ll talk about how we scraped facebook for leads and emailed them links to two landing pages to come out with conclusive results on the above tests.</p>
