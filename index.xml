&lt;h1 id=&#34;technical-opportunities&#34;&gt;Technical Opportunities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m open to technical opportunities of all kinds. I work best using React.js, React Native or Golang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work on some great projects with even better people. Here are a few nice memories I&amp;rsquo;d like to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I co-built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://collinglass.github.io/gamerbet/&#34;&gt;real-time Esports betting platform&lt;/a&gt; when I co-founded GamerBet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built a UX dashboard at Macadamian which is know delivered to customers with UX work. I pitched it for a job application a few years ago here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXvfMNC9rY&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXvfMNC9rY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on to build out 6 beautiful graphs with D3.js for an Ionic app. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the Chief Architect at Macadamian had to say about my work. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/collinglass#recommendations&#34;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/collinglass#recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;growth-opportunities&#34;&gt;Growth Opportunities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was drawn to Growth roles the minute I heard about them. Since I was in high school I&amp;rsquo;ve felt equally interested in business and programming. I&amp;rsquo;ve always known I wanted to be somewhere in the harmony of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all startups I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of, I&amp;rsquo;ve held CTO and developer roles. I&amp;rsquo;ve built the tech stack, each one has gotten farther along than the last. Each time there has been a problem with traction and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my growthhackers.com account around Christmas 2015. I started &lt;a href=&#34;https://collinglass.github.io/my-first-growth-project/&#34;&gt;running experiments&lt;/a&gt; on the side in July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m open to opportunities in Growth and Technical business roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find everything I&amp;rsquo;ve created worth mentioning. If you genuinely think it&amp;rsquo;s cool, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to show so love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mvbi&#34;&gt;MVBI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimum Viable Business Intelligence is a simple mobile app that allows you to get up to date information on how your business is doing. I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://collinglass.github.io/minimum-viable-business-intelligence/&#34;&gt;why you need it and why you would buy it instead of building it in-house&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;At the time, Pokemon Go had not been released in Canada at the time. Many small businesses were already capitalizing on the local opportunity in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biz partner Mark and I decided to see if local businesses in our community were interested in a managed Pokemon Go service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to test to see if marketers and growth hackers are looking for an authoritative source in marketing to Pokemon Go players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two ideas to test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketers are looking for an authoritative source to market to Pokemon Go players&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local businesses will pay for a managed service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided we would start testing idea 1 with a landing page. Idea 2 was better suited for cold call emailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also decided that this venture needed to make at least 1,000$/month for it to make sense for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;test-1&#34;&gt;Test #1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were excited to put together a landing page and launch it to Growth Hackers. We figured this is buzzing right now, we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to score a few 100 signups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did some research. Shops were seeing increases in sales by adding lure modules to the nearest pokestop around their business. We decided to put together a PDF guide on how to add a lure module to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a landing page that required an email opt-in to get the guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://collinglass.github.io/img/first-landing-pokebiz.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; alt=&#34;First Landing Page&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We waited until the next morning to post it. We then posted it to GrowthHackers got a few friends to upvote to give it some initial traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://collinglass.github.io/img/gh-pokebiz.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; alt=&#34;Pokebiz&#39;s first article on GH&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We waited 14 days before concluding the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got 6 upvotes from our friends which got us in the trending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were disappointing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got 0 organic upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;257 views and 4 email opt-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s about a 1.56% conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this experiment failed for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are other more authoritive sites covering pokemon go marketing already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are other sites where you can get this guide without entering your email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are unsure or don&amp;rsquo;t believe Pokemon Go is worth investing time into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, it may seem obvious this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work. In the moment it felt better to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;test-2&#34;&gt;Test #2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the landing page was out we started working on our email campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to go after pizza shops and coffee shops. They were the businesses getting the most attention in the press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a script that scraped facebook for leads. I got 113 Ottawa coffee shops with emails and about the same for pizza shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark wrote the email and we included a link to our website. We finished scraping and writing up the email on Saturday. We scheduled the email blast for first thing Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our emails went out a day after Pokemon Go was released in Canada, our timing was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;results-1&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got 11 replies wanting to schedule a meeting. We were pumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We felt like we had validation. Everytime I got a new email back we had a big grin on our face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We scheduled meetings starting Wednesday morning, only two days away. We were moving fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go into these meetings pitching. I wanted to do customer development. But, I also needed to have answers to their questions. We took to the whiteboard again and put together an offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 60$/month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertisement on our Pokemon Groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guides/Installation Support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One 4 hour event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came out with this number with a mix of cost calculations and revenue projections. It would take us 20 customers to make 1200$/month. Not a lot of money but it was a number that motivated us for a side project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, we never pitched this offering in the meeting. Instead, it provided Mark and I a base point we were comfortable with. This allowed us to ask the right questions and feel out if this was going to be a viable business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next week we had 1 in-person meeting and the rest were over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we found out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the shops were either going to or already putting lures themselves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were all interested in getting insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were interested in helping us out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every meeting, something became clearer. It was going to be hard to make money with this business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-1&#34;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local businesses that would profit from a Pokemon Go presence had young staff. They were already running or preparing to run lure modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our leads were interested in getting insights. But, they weren&amp;rsquo;t ready to pay for insights. If they did, it going to be a large amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were interested in advertising opportunity if we had clear numbers to show them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran some numbers from the shops point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we brought them 40 customer purchases a month at 3$ average sale amount, that gives them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 * 3$ = 120$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around online to find coffee shop profit margins. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/How-much-profit-does-Starbucks-make-on-a-typical-coffee&#34;&gt;quora question&lt;/a&gt; had the best result with 33% profit margin. Calculating their profit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;120$ * 33% = 40$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we would charge them 25% of that. 10$ a month for our service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this venture to make enough revenue for us we need to scale to at least 100 customers. Which means we&amp;rsquo;d had to be responsible for 4,000 customer purchases a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Facebook Group only had +400 members and the top Facebook group in Ottawa only had 2,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at increasing monthly fee to 20$, requiring us to scale to at least 50 customers. We would have to be responsible for 2,000 customer purchases a month. Even with the combined reach of the existing Facebook, Slack and Discord communities, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deemed this business not viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profits were too low for our interest. Additionally, this business is at the mercy of the popularity of Pokemon Go. Mark and I are not confident enough that it&amp;rsquo;s here to stay. Especially here in Ottawa where it&amp;rsquo;ll be -20 outside in a short few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;note&#34;&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far my most extensive experience as the main Backend architect on a project.
We created a micro service architecture from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole, the application polled Riot&amp;rsquo;s API for new games, inserted them into the database through the API. When a new game is inserted, we run a webscraper for each player to get their latest stats. The application also polled Riot&amp;rsquo;s API for recently ended games then updated them if they were present in the database. When a game was successfully ended we sent a Server Sent Event to every web browser to launch a success or completed modal to all users who bet on that game. Through the Web client, users are able to signup for an account, place bets on open games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our application components&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web client written in Angular.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API written in Golang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website Scraper for LoLKing.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socket.io WebSockets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/gamerbet/architecture.png&#34; alt=&#34;Architecture&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;web-client&#34;&gt;Web client&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web client was mostly written by my Co Founder Phil Swanson. It used websockets with a socket.io service to live update games and alert users on wins and losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;api&#34;&gt;API&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API consists of a set of HTTP handlers grouped into 3 different access levels: public, authenticated, and secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;public&#34;&gt;Public&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public contains all the HTTP requests that are necessary to view the site as a visitor and nothing more. Think, get open games, get leaderboard, and all other visual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;authenticated&#34;&gt;Authenticated&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authenticated routes are all routes specific to user actions, that require a logged in user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used token based authentication. The way token based auth works is a user enters a username and password. If the username and password are correct then we give them back a token and store their public user data as a value in Redis and use their token as the key. The client saves the token in their local storage and sends it on every request. Whenever a request is made, the API takes the token out of the HTTP headers and checks if Redis has a value on that key. If it does, we take the necessary data from redis and associate it with the given request. For example, a user is placing a bet. We take his user id and assign it to the new bet object so we&amp;rsquo;ll know who placed that bet when it comes time to pay money out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;secret-routes&#34;&gt;Secret routes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secret routes are routes used only by internal services. They are given a unique token that only works with those routes. No client issued token will work with these routes and there are no login routes for these routes. For example, the event manager POSTs new games to the database. We don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone but the event manager to post new games to the database, so we generated a single crypto secure token and hard coded in the event manager and the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;postgresql&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used PostgreSQL as our database and used GORM Object Relational Mapper for most interaction and had a few routes using custom joins to optimize their speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use primary keys, unique constraints and all the other goodies. Additionally, one thing I like to do is use the database for all my validation. I use CHECKs to check validate lengths and characters. It keeps all parts of my application in sync. Error messages are transformed into human readable text and bubbled up all the way to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;website-scraper&#34;&gt;Website Scraper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riot&amp;rsquo;s API did not have any valuable player stats. Nor was there any other API that existed for this. We created a scraper for the most popular fan made website. It runs an exact match search on the website and returns the stats if the player is found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;event-manager&#34;&gt;Event Manager&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important peice of the application. My co-founder Phil wrote it originally in python. I later rewrote it in golang. It polled Riot&amp;rsquo;s API for new games and for newly ended games. It then updated our database accordingly. After we realized people didn&amp;rsquo;t care about amateur games (they only wanted to bet on pro players), we added a clause to only add games to our database that contained pro players in the match.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jocuri Unity 3D is an online gaming site specializing in Unity 3D games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pet project of mine to learn SEO and test experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main screen of the website features a Netflix inspired layout of games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/jocuri/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented a block to force users to play without adblock. Adblock agents block the users browser from making any requests to known ad domains and any websites or files with the word &amp;ldquo;ads&amp;rdquo; in it. I created a file called showads.js and added a single global variable called AdblockIsDisabled = true; Then after 30 seconds I check for the presence of this variable. If it&amp;rsquo;s false or undefined, I know the users browser has an adblocker and I replace the game with this message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/jocuri/2.png&#34; alt=&#34;2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms have clear error messages displayed to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/jocuri/3.png&#34; alt=&#34;4&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with responsive design to handle mobile pages as it allows for quicker updates to the site as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liberwave is a student to student textbook selling app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main screen of the app features a location based search using Google Maps and Google Places API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/liberwave/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students create listings with a beautiful and responsive form. We used Google Books API to autofill the details for known books. Students can also easily take pictures of their book to show the current condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/liberwave/2.png&#34; alt=&#34;2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/liberwave/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;4&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose a side navigation menu that easily slides in and out of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/liberwave/5.png&#34; alt=&#34;5&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are rated after every transaction to ensure accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/work/liberwave/6.png&#34; alt=&#34;6&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy and sell multiple books at a time with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
